		<h2 id="f1">I already signed a CLA</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				If you already signed a Contributor License Agreement, then  your data has been imported into the new tooling in order to provide automatic integration with GitHub.
				If your signature did not include your GitHub username, then you will need to perform a few steps to link your GitHub account to your signature.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/">Associate the email address used to sign the agreement to your GitHub account</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address/">Verify your email address</a></li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://cla.pivotal.io/">Sign into the new CLA tool</a>.
					You must sign into the tool after you have linked your email address.
					This is necessary because, for privacy reasons, GitHub will not allow the tooling to view your email addresses without your consent.
				</li>
				<li>You may need to log out and then log back in to update your email address.</li>
			</ol>

			Note: If you do not want to follow these steps, you can always sign the <a href="https://cla.pivotal.io/">Contributor License Agreement</a> again.

		<div>
			<p>
				A corporate signature is either associated to the domain of a verified email address or a GitHub organization.
			</p>
			<h3>Email Domain</h3>
			<p>
				If your company signed the agreement based upon an email domain, then you will need to perform a few steps to link your GitHub account to your signature.
				This flow is only for legacy signatures.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/">Associate an email email address</a> with your company's domain to your GitHub account.
					For example, if your company is Pivotal, you would want to associate myemail@pivotal.io to your GitHub account.

			</ol>
			<h3>GitHub Organization</h3>
			<p>If your company associated the signature to a GitHub organization, then you must ensure the following is true.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your GitHub account is a member of the selected organization</li>
				<li>You have made your <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/'>membership public</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="f3">The Pull Request Status Did Not Update</h2>
			<p>
				If the status of a Pull Request did not update:
				<ul>
					<li>If the GitHub status did not update, check <a href="https://status.github.com">https://status.github.com</a>. If GitHub is having issues, the event may have not been sent to the application.</li>
					<li>If your went directly to the tooling vs using the link provided on the Pull Request, the Pull Request will not be automatically updated. This is due to limitations in the GitHub API. You can force an update of the status using the "manually synchronize" link provided on the Pull Request.</li>
