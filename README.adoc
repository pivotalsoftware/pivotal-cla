This tool is intended to allow managing GitHub Contributor License Agreements.

= Setup

Below are the steps that are necessary to set this project up.

== Register a new OAuth application with GitHub

This application uses https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/[OAuth to access GitHub's APIs].
The first step is to https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application] with GitHub.

Example values for the form might be:

* *Application Name* - Pivotal CLA
* *Homepage URL* - https://pivotal.io
* *Application description* - Allows managing Contributor License Agreements for contributions to Pivotal sponsored projects
* *Authorization callback URL* - This needs to point back to your application's OAuth endpoint.
For development it might be http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/github
If you are needing to test receiving GitHub events, you will probably want to setup https://ngrok.com/#download[ngrok].
If you are using ngrok, the URL would look something like https://123456.ngrok.io/login/oauth2/github

After clicking *Register application* you should make the application aware of the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret*.

Create a new file named *application-local.properties*

.src/main/resources/application-local.properties
[source]
----
# Replace values from registered application at https://github.com/settings/developers
# See the README for additional detail
security.oauth2.main.clientId=Value from Client ID
security.oauth2.main.clientSecret=Value from Client Secret
----

== Register a personal access token

* Generate a [New personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) that contains only `public_repo` scope.
This will be used for adding comments to pull requests that require the contributor to sign the CLA.
* Copy the personal access token and place it in application-local.properties

Modify *application-local.properties*

.src/main/resources/application-local.properties
[source]
----
# Replace values from registered application at https://github.com/settings/developers
# See the README for additional detail
security.oauth2.main.clientId=Value from Client ID
security.oauth2.main.clientSecret=Value from Client Secret
security.oauth2.pivotal-cla.tokenSecret=A Personal Access Token with public_repo scope
----

== Setup ngrok

If you are needing to test receiving GitHub events, you will probably want to setup https://ngrok.com/#download[ngrok].
If there is no need to test reciving the GitHub events from GitHub, then you can skip this step.

= Running the Application

== Gradle

You can run the application using:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

This mode enables the `local` profile which uses H2 for the in-memory database and Redis for storing sessions.
Redis *must* be started locally on port `6379`.

=== Open the Application

You can open the application at a context root of "/".
If you are running, the default URL is at http://localhost:8080/

== Cloud Foundry

Deploying the application to Cloud Foundry can be performed as part of the build using the [Cloud Foundry Gradle plugin](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/java/build-tool-int.html#gradle).
It's set up for TravisCI and manual deployment mode.

=== Required Properties

Deployment scripts for `pivotal-cla` require a set of properties to be deployed. Please keep in mind that secrets should not get published.

* `cfUsername`: Your username to log into Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* `cfPassword`: Your password to log into Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* `security.oauth2.main.clientId`: GitHub Client ID
* `security.oauth2.main.clientSecret`: GitHub Client Secret
* `security.oauth2.pivotal-cla.tokenSecret`: A Personal Access Token with public_repo scope
* For manual deployment only: `space`: Name of the space

=== Variants (aka. Blue/Green-Deployment)

Production and Staging have blue/green deployment set up. That's done by setting the `variants` property of the [Cloud Foundry Gradle plugin](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/java/build-tool-int.html#gradle).
Setting `variants` causes `cfDeploy` to check which variant is active and deploy to the inactive variant. The deployment
task switches blue/green instances using `cfSwapDeployed` once the application is deployed and started.

To recover from a failed swapping or deployment, it's required to unmap application routes and re-trigger deployment.

=== TravisCI

TravisCI builds for the `master` branch get deployed to production. Builds for branches starting with `staging-` get deployed to the staging space.
The build is set up to provide deployment properties as environment variables:

* `CF_USERNAME`
* `CF_PASSWORD`
* `CLIENT_ID`
* `CLIENT_SECRET`
* `TOKEN_SECRET`

=== Manual Deployment with Gradle

Manual deployment with Gradle can be performed by invoking Gradle directly from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble deploy -Pspace=<space>
----

The manual deployment with Gradle defaults to pivotal as organization and requires `space` to be provided.
It activates the `cloudfoundry` profile which requires a MySQL database and a Redis instance.

=== Manual Deployment with `cf push`

You can deploy `pivotal-cla` using `cf push`. This mode is isolated from any organization and space preferences.

[source,bash]
----
$ cf push -p build/libs/pivotal-cla-<version>.jar
----

== Profiles

`pivotal-cla` uses two profiles to distinguish between running modes:

* `local` (enabled by default): Use a H2 in-memory database
* `cloudfoundry`: Use a MySQL database, Spring Session and Spring Data Redis. All connectors are obtained using Spring Cloud.
