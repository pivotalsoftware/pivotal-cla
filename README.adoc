This tool is intended to allow managing GitHub Contributor License Agreements.

= Setup

Below are the steps that are necessary to set this project up.

== Register a new OAuth application with GitHub

This application uses https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/[OAuth to access GitHub's APIs].
The first step is to https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application] with GitHub.

Example values for the form might be:

* *Application Name* - Pivotal CLA
* *Homepage URL* - https://pivotal.io
* *Application description* - Allows managing Contributor License Agreements for contributions to Pivotal sponsored projects
* *Authorization callback URL* - This needs to point back to your application's OAuth endpoint.
For development it might be http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/github
If you are needing to test receiving GitHub events, you will probably want to setup https://ngrok.com/#download[ngrok].
If you are using ngrok, the URL would look something like https://123456.ngrok.io/login/oauth2/github

After clicking *Register application* you should make the application aware of the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret*.

Create a new file named *application-local.properties*

.src/main/resources/application-local.properties
[source]
----
# Replace values from registered application at https://github.com/settings/developers
# See the README for additional detail
security.oauth2.main.clientId=Value from Client ID
security.oauth2.main.clientSecret=Value from Client Secret
----

== Register a personal access token

* Generate a [New personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) that contains only `public_repo` scope.
This will be used for adding comments to pull requests that require the contributor to sign the CLA.
* Copy the personal access token and place it in application-local.properties

Modify *application-local.properties*

.src/main/resources/application-local.properties
[source]
----
# Replace values from registered application at https://github.com/settings/developers
# See the README for additional detail
security.oauth2.main.clientId=Value from Client ID
security.oauth2.main.clientSecret=Value from Client Secret
security.oauth2.pivotal-cla.tokenSecret=A Personal Access Token with public_repo scope
----

== Setup ngrok

If you are needing to test receiving GitHub events, you will probably want to setup https://ngrok.com/#download[ngrok].
If there is no need to test reciving the GitHub events from GitHub, then you can skip this step.

= Running the Application

== Gradle

You can run the application using:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

== Open the Application

You can open the application at a context root of "/".
If you are running, the default URL is at http://localhost:8080/
